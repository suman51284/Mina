Mina Font Project
===================

Mina is a geometric Bangla (Bengali) and Latin typeface family that conveys a contemporary feeling through elegant design.
Mina has been designed as a set of two weights, Regular and Bold.
The project began by extending Exo, designed by Natanael Gama, into Bangla while retaining the essence of the traditional aspects of Bangla letter construction when reducing the forms into low contrast strokes.
It can be used as a display typeface but it works well at small to intermediate text sizes.
